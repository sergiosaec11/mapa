    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    E1:B0:67:A6:EB:7B:C9:A6:48:C8:B6:2C:7F:16:75:49:26:5F:F4:B6

    E1:B0:67:A6:EB:7B:C9:A6:48:C8:B6:2C:7F:16:75:49:26:5F:F4:B6

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
